# Trello Clone

This project first started as the generic to do list project every programmer has in their projects, but I started doing it because I wanted to learn how to use supabase for my first project with a real client. So after learning supabase entirely, I started doing a trello clone with a similar authentication system that I am going to use in the project mentioned earlier.
